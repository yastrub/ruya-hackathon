# 90-Second Pitch

## Problem
Sales teams lose warm leads because responses are inconsistent, do not adapt to objections, and fail to escalate from text to calls at the right moment.

## Solution
We built a self-improving closer agent that learns from lead feedback, adapts strategy by objection type, and optimizes behavior autonomously over time across two channels:

- Text: Instagram DM / WhatsApp
- Voice: ElevenLabs Agents API outbound calls via Twilio

## Demo Proof
In each round, the agent evaluates response quality, updates memory, and improves its policy. The average performance score rises between rounds while random exploration decreases. In later rounds, the agent escalates selected high-friction leads to voice follow-up automatically.

## Why It Matters
This enables scalable, consistent closing quality without requiring every rep to be senior-level, while orchestrating the best channel per lead.

## Closing
This is not just automation. It is an adaptive sales intelligence loop: learn, adapt, optimize.
